    "description": "\n*DevHub is Socure confidential and proprietary information, and is only intended for viewing by authorized persons.* \n\n# Overview\n\nThe Socure ID+ identity verification solution is a real-time, predictive\nanalytics platform that provides identity verification and fraud prediction\nthrough a single, modular REST API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nWhen you call Socure's APIs, you must authenticate each request with an ID+ key. Socure associates each ID+ key with a Socure account. You can generate and collect your account's ID+ key from the **Developers > ID+ Keys** page in Admin Dashboard. See [ID+ Keys](/docs/admin-dashboard/developers/id-plus-keys) for more information.\n\n```\nAuthorization: SocureApiKey a1b234cd-5678-9e01-f234-56abcdef6789\n\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n```\n\nThe following table details the base URLs for the Production, Certification, and Sandbox environments and their corresponding authorization header:\n\nEnvironment | Base URL | Authorization Header\n-------------|----------| -----------------\nProduction |   `https://service.socure.com`    | SocureApiKey <Your_Production_ID+_Key>\nCertification | \t`https://service.socure.com` | SocureApiKey <Your_Certification_ID+_Key>\nSandbox | `https://sandbox.socure.com` | SocureApiKey <Your_Sandbox_ID+_Key>\n\n## Traffic Segmentation \n\nTraffic segmentation, available for customers with specific provisions using the ID+ `/EmailAuthScore` endpoint, can be implemented by adding the following parameters to a request body when calling ID+ modules:\n \n<table class=\"feedback\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th class=\"enums\">Parameter</th>\n      <th>Type</th>\n      <th>Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>eventType</code></td>\n      <td>String</td>\n      <td><strong>Required</strong>. Supports a pre-defined enumeration of event types that allow for better customization for transaction processing and billing using the following values: <code>payment</code>, <code>fundsMovement</code>, <code>login</code>, <code>accountOpen</code>, <code>accountChange</code>, and <code>other</code>.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>eventSubType</code></td>\n      <td>String</td>\n      <td>A free-form field that allows the user to provide a more descriptive value for the event (\u2264 255 characters). <br /> <strong>Note</strong>: This field is not needed for a vast majority of clients and is optional. Clients should only implement this field if asked to do so by the Account Manager, who will also advise on what value to use.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>channel</code></td>\n      <td>String</td>\n      <td><strong>Required</strong>. Supports a pre-defined enumeration of channels, enabling users to specify the mode of interaction on the consumer's end using the following values: <code>web</code>, <code>mobile</code>, <code>pos</code>, and <code>other</code>.</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>    \n\nThe example below demonstrates how to include the segmentation object in the body of an API call.\n\n```\n{\n  \"segmentation\": {\n      \"eventType\": \"accountOpen\",\n      \"eventSubType\": \"...\",\n      \"channel\": \"mobile\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nHTTP status codes indicate the success or failure of an API request. If a request fails, the API returns a message with information about the error along with the appropriate status code. See [Exception Handling](/docs/id-plus/endpoints-and-apis/exception-handling) for more information.\n\n> Error messages are intended for debug purposes only and should not be exposed to customers.\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"Error\",\n  \"referenceId\": \"81cf9bf1-b5ab-4271-bf92-8809ee1bf8d6\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"parameters\": [\n      \"Missing required parameters for module: FraudScore\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"msg\": \"Invalid request. Please check for missing required parameters and resubmit the transaction. \"\n}\n\n```\n\n### Error codes\n\n| Code                               | Reason                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 400 - Bad Request                  | The request wasn't successful, often due to an invalid, missing, or mutually exclusive parameter.                                                                                  |\n| 401 - Unauthorized                 | No valid ID+ key, referenceID, or entity ID was provided.                                                                                                                           |\n| 403 - Forbidden                    | The ID+ key isn't provisioned to serve the request.                                                                                                                                |\n| 404 - Not Found                    | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                                                                                                              |\n| 429 - Too Many Requests            | You've hit a rate limit. Contact Technical Support to see how we can help you scale responsibly. We default all clients to a rate limit of 10 transactions per second per ID+ key. |\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on Socure's end. On these rare occasions, we're probably already on it but reach out to our support group anyway.                                             |\n\n## Rate Limits\n\nSocure defaults all clients to a rate limit of 10 transactions per second (TPS) per ID+ key (except the Image Request endpoint, which has a rate limit of 1 TPS). To increase rate limits for your account, contact [Technical Support](/support).\n\n## Requests\n\nHTTPS is required for all API calls to Socure endpoints. TLS 1.3 is the default and preferred protocol version for encryption; however, we do allow TLS 1.2 as a minimum version when making ID+ API calls.\n\n### Authorization\n\nYou must provide an authorization header as described in the [Authentication](/reference#section/Overview/Authentication) section above. \n\n### Content-Type\n\nThe <code>Content-Type</code> header identifies the media type of the content in the request body. For all requests with a body, the body may be in <code>JSON</code> format, or other formats as specified for the endpoint.  \n\n## Responses\n\nCalls to the ID+ Platform return HTTP status codes. Some API calls also return a JSON response body that includes information about the resource. See the **Responses** section for each endpoint to learn more.\n\n# Postman Collection\n\nSocure provides a Postman collection for consumers to make API calls through the Sandbox environment.\nThe collection contains sample use cases with requests to various ID+ modules. \n\n<a href=\"/assets/api-spec.json\" download=\"socure-postman-collection\"> <button class=\"postman-button\"> Postman Collection </button></a>\n\n\nFor effective testing in Postman, we suggest the following:\n  - Download and import the pre-built environments provided below into Postman. These environments contain examples of consumer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that you can set before making any call.\n\n    <a href=\"/assets/example-consumer-1.json\" download=\"consumer-environment-1\"> <button class=\"postman-button\"> Consumer Environment 1</button></a> \n\n    <a href=\"/assets/example-consumer-2.json\" download=\"consumer-environment-2\"> <button class=\"postman-button\"> Consumer Environment 2</button></a>\n  - To streamline input and avoid repetition, configure the base URLs, authorization, and device session ID as variables. See [Set environment variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) for more information.\n  - For testing the `devicerisk` module in the Sandbox environment, use the test device session IDs provided in the [Device Risk Examples](/docs/advanced-concepts/sandbox-test-scenarios/#device-risk-examples) document.\n\n\n# Backward Compatible Changes\n\nSocure considers the following changes to be backward compatible:\n  - Adding new API resources.\n  - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.\n  - Adding new properties to existing API responses.\n  - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.\n",
